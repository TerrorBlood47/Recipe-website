        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul style="font-size: 23px;">
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 cups fresh peaches, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (for peach filling)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol style="font-size: 23px;">
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, 1 cup of granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. 
               Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>n a small bowl, beat the egg and vanilla extract together. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix until well combined. The dough will be crumbly.</li>
            <li>Press half of the dough into the bottom of the greased baking dish, making an even layer.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix the sliced peaches, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, cornstarch, and ground cinnamon until well coated.</li>
            <li>Spread the peach mixture evenly over the crust in the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining dough mixture evenly over the peaches.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the peach filling is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool completely before cutting into squares.</li>
            <li>Serve the peach crumb bars at room temperature or chilled. You can also dust them with powdered sugar before serving, if desired.</li>
